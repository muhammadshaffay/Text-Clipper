# Text-Clipper
A tool that quickly and accurately segments Urdu sentences and words in your text.

The Urdu Text-Clipper is a software tool designed to segment Urdu language text into words. It uses three approaches: forward, backward, and hybrid to achieve high accuracy in word segmentation. The forward approach segments the text from right to left, while the backward approach segments the text from left to right. The hybrid approach combines both forward and backward approaches to provide the most accurate segmentation. The validity of selected word is checked from a corpus containing 150K+ urdu words. 

This tool is particularly useful for natural language processing applications such as machine translation, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis. It can help improve the accuracy of these applications by providing more accurate input.
